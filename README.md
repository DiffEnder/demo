# Demo Repository: Diffing Code, Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks

This is a demo repository to showcase the ability to diff different types of files, including:

- Python code files (see `code-example.py`)
- Markdown files (like this `README.md`)
- Jupyter Notebooks (see `pandas-example.ipynb`)

## Features

- See how changes in code are tracked, including function changes and bug fixes.
- Markdown diffs are supported, so you can see what text was added or removed.
- Jupyter notebook diffs let you see changes in both code and output cells, but not always the outputs.

## Example Files

- `code-example.py`: Contains basic math functions like add, substract, multiply, divide, and modulus.
- `pandas-example.ipynb`: Shows how to do operations on pandas DataFrames and Series, and includes some random data.

## How to Use

Just browse the files and make some changes. You can try to add new functions, fix typos, or change some notebook cells to see how the diffing works.

## Known Issues

- Sometimes the notebook outputs are not shown in the diff.
- There may be some spelling errors in the code and markdowns.
- The code is not tested for all edge cases.

Enjoy exploring the repo!
